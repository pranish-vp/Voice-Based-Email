Voice Based Email for Visually Challenged People
The proposed project aims to develop a voice-based email system for individuals with visual impairments using Python. The system will use speech recognition technology to convert user input into text and text-to-speech technology to read emails aloud to the user. The user will be able to compose and send emails using voice commands, making the process more accessible and convenient for those with visual impairments. The system will also include features for managing email folders and reading email headers, allowing users to easily navigate their inbox. The implementation of the system will involve the use of various Python libraries to integrate speech recognition and text-to-speech functionality. The proposed system has the potential to significantly enhance the accessibility of email communication for individuals with visual impairments.
